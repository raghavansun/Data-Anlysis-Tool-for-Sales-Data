# Project Title: Data Analysis Tool for Sales Data

Project Description:
A data analysis tool for sales data. This tool is capable of processing a CSV file containing sales data and generating insights such as total sales, average sales per month, top-selling products, and sales trends over time. Additionally, it provides visualizations such as bar charts and line plots to illustrate the data analysis.

Here's a basic outline of the approach:
  1. Read the CSV File: Use the pandas library to read the CSV file containing the sales data into a DataFrame.
  2. Data Cleaning and Preparation: Perform any necessary data cleaning and preparation steps, such as handling missing values, converting data types, and parsing dates.
  3. Calculate Total Sales: Create a function to calculate the total sales from the sales data.
  4. Calculate Average Sales per Month: Implement a function to calculate the average sales per month. This involves grouping the data by month and then calculating the mean sales for each month.
  5. Identify Top-Selling Products: Write a function to identify the top-selling products. This can be done by grouping the data by product and then summing the sales for each product, followed by sorting the products based
                                   on sales.
  6. Generate Visualizations: Use matplotlib (or seaborn) to generate visualizations such as bar charts to visualize sales by product category and line plots to show sales trends over time.
  7. User Input for Time Frame: Provide options for the user to specify the time frame for analysis, such as monthly or quarterly. Allow the user to input the desired time frame when running the script.
  8. Documentation: Write detailed documentation explaining the functionality of the tool, how to use it, and any dependencies or installation instructions.
  9. Testing and Validation: Test the tool with different datasets to ensure that it produces accurate results and handles edge cases appropriately.
  10. Package and Delivery: Package the Python script along with any necessary dependencies and installation instructions. Deliver the script and documentation to the client.
